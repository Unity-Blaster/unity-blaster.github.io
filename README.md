# **Project-Info**

**Notice: This Project is Under-Development & is a Hobby. So, Don't Expect Frequent Updates.**

*This is all of the code used in my first website, which I created as part of my journey of learning Web Development.*

You can go to the website [here](https://unity-blaster.github.io/TestSite/) (https://unity-blaster.github.io).<br>
If you want to make modifications to the program, you open the files in any other Online/Offline Code Editor, or in [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://vscode.dev/) (which I used for this project).

## Contributing/Distributions
Please note that I won't be able to accept pull requests all the time (most of the time rather), as I'm a student who has a lot to do in the real life as well, but you're welcome to create your own fork of the project or contribute to my learning-experience! If you plan on distributing your version, please make sure that it's following [The Licencing Guidelines](#licencing).

## Licencing
The distro has to follow the [Unlicence Licence](/LICENSE.txt) and the following guidelines:--

1. The project must be free to download (accepting donations is fine), and the source code must be available publicaly and should not be hard to reach to (shouldn't be hidden in directories).
2. There should be some indication, in the distribution, that it's not the official version.
3. There should be a link to the official version.
4. The licencing should be updated whenever the project is updated.

## Misc
[I'll add more to Read-Me Later. Cuz it's not That important.]
